# Hidden Inventory

<p>
  <strong>Goal:</strong> Create and inspire a robust 2(.5)d physics engine in written Solidity
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Method:</strong> Create neat microgames that leverage singular physics mechanics
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Form:</strong> A website where one can browse micro games. Solidity available to view but interaction and game is entirely off chain for simplicity.
</p>

We aim to make a mobile-friendly version to increase distribution.
